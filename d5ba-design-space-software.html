But before I could come up with my own designs and such, I wanted to try and print some existing stickers on different kinds of materials and see how the looked/cut. These are my experiment results, using different kinds of labels that I got as free samples from OnlineLabels.com (https://OnlineLabels.com) (OL), WorldLabel.com.

Best Overall: SketchUp Pro at Sketchup.com, “Unquestionably the best home design software out there.” Best Budget: Total 3D Home, Landscape & Deck Premium Suite at Amazon, "Upload your own sketches or choose from 14,000 samples to get your planning started.". Greetings. I've tried my best to explain my situation, but sometimes that's not enough or is just too much to confuse. This is related to Solar Thermal Parabolic Concentrators and designing a solar field with optimum spacing. Please refer to this animation first: https://imgur.com/a/OVKlqOZ The animation does not depict the actual model of the parabolic dish but only their aperture area. I'm setting up a large solar field with parabolic solar concentrators with the thermal receiver attached. I set up my new maker and kicked off the sample card in less than 10 minutes. So no problem with the out of box experience. The unit produces high quality printing and die cutting and I look forward to using the knife blade I ordered on some thicker materials. I expected a lot of marketing and wasn’t disappointed there. Yay unsubscribe. The design space software though. wow, not happy so far. As others mentioned, it’s sluggish and requires a lot of Explain Like I’m Five, even though Title pretty much sums it up. I'm going to pick up a cricut maker today and wondering if once I get passed the learning curve if I could move to other software, or if the cricut couls only interface with its own software. I'm preparing to print something for the community of those who happen to be blind. APHont website says it's not free for commercial use. Verdana seems too spaced out to keep words distinct, Tahoma and Arial seem to be a happy medium, and Helvetica would save space with my longer publication. All input appreciated. Edit: added why can't use APHont. Also, sorry, forgot to put the person before Hey Folks, I'm a makerspace teacher and we have a Maslow CNC. We have quickly surpassed the use cases for this machine and we are looking for a 4x8ft CNC Router machine (hopefully could also do thin sheet metal). I wanted to hear what experience you have with these machines and if there is one that you think is hands down the best option. Thanks, Y'all. I'm getting really REALLY tired of the dammed plugin load errors and then the design space "app" (web site) trying to reload after N seconds. Happens pretty much every time I try to do anything. And the iPad app vs. the web app? Would be great if the designs were 100% portable between the two. But they aren't. And there is no indication as what the bloody incompatible features are. As well, no real support forum for reporting bugs. Nowhere to check for server status. Credit. 
Hey guys - first off, thank you for participating in this community, it helped me a lot during my journey as a UI/UX designer. So, I've sent my portfolio to one of the local companies and they invited me to an interview. I know that there's a high level demand for this job, so there's many guys like me who want to get the job. I wanted to ask you for advice - since the interview is on Friday and I basically have a week of free time, is there anything additional I can learn / do to improve So I bought an Explore Air 2 for the wife, and I want to buy her a dedicated little thing for running the Design Space software. The system requirements are listed as 4GB of ram which seems a bit excessive considering the iOS version will run on an iPhone 5. I was thinking about buying this tablet as a starter as it’s cheap and I can find another use for it if it doesn’t perform too well: Amazon - Nextbook Flexx8 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0786GD82R/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fBwSAbWPTDVMZ) Anyone. The Classic layout is not available anymore, it was way easier to navigate Now you have to open the reviews section separately. it's clunky New != Better. Being that Crocut doesn't support its legacy machines anymore. Is there a recommendation on software to use? Complete noob to Cricut. Hello! My wife birthday is coming up and I was wanting to buy her a cricut explore air 2. Mainly for making stickers for her planner. I do a lot of graphic design in illustrator and also make pixel art and I was going to make stickers for her on these platforms. However, I am kind of confused as to how the Cricut explore air 2 knows where to cut. Does it automatically know the borders of my stickers? Or do I load the same sticker layout into some software and it uses that to figure out where.
